               |In Spring 2020, as part of IAT 431 Speculative Design, my final month-long project explored a lengthy and involved process of 
               mark preparing for one's own death in a symbiotic relationship with another living organism, fungi. 
                my final project explored the emergent conversations and rituals around the fungi, and how this affects one’s relationship with death.
