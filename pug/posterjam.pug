        p.ml-sect I interpreted "surprise" as juxtaposition for this poster. Legendary graphic designer Massimo Vignelli's quote juxtaposes with the use of

          |, which most certainly is not not among the "few basic ones". My choice of grid also reflects Vignelli's strong use of grids in his graphic design. The transparency of the visible grid  directs the eye through the poster.

        h4 Figure A
        p This poster incorporates 2 interpretations of grids. The first is the unconventional but essential radial grid, which I decided to distort to radiate from a point to create a flow for the eye, where it collides with the second grid - the rows and columns that emerge from monospaced typography.

        h4 Figure A
        p '2' reminded me of a photograph I took of 2 school-children, friends or possibly brothers, and a quote by author C.S Lewis “Friendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‘What! You too? I thought I was the only one”. I experimented with alignment, using graphical elements as compositional supports, and textures till I came to this composition. 

        h4 Figure B
        p A no.2 pencil was a ubiquitous “2” that came to mind. I used this as another opportunity to explore using texture. I attempted to replicate  lined paper, albeit with a underlaid pencil. I also reused the photograph from my previous poster, using the children' outline to create a seating ledge, to act as a counterbalance to the pencil.

        h4 Figure C
        p In this poster, I utilized the concept of a Antichthon, planets in the same orbit but on opposing ends of the orbital ellipse. The noisy sphere assets were used to create visual interest, and similar lines were used otherwise to present a unified system.
