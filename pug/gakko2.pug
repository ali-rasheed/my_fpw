          |Gakko is an educational collective runs annual summer camps created by a select group of mentors from fields ranging from design to theatre to disaster management. 
          //- |Gakko is a global educational collective that builds spaces, experiences &amp tools to reclaim the magic of learning. It runs an annual international summer camp that is built from the ground up by a selected group of <em>Sempai</em> camp creators over a two-week long prep. <em>Kohai</em> campers arrived post-prep for a further two weeks of camp.

          |Though conceptualised initially as an introduction to graphic design, my main investigation landed upon conveying why I am passionate about typography as it narrowed down a niche that is not particularly well known and was something I particularly cared about within graphic design. This made it respectively more insightful of a topic and made it easier to draw upon personal examples when presenting.
        p.ml-sect I focused on how <strong>typography influences your decisions and perception in ways most people don’t realise</strong>, and how<strong> the intricacies of and accentuated differences within typefaces define their individual identity </strong>as well within greater culture.

          figcaption Selection of slide deck shown to kohai to provide context and knowledge to kohai
        p.ml-sect All main investigations were put through <strong>a series of short design sprints </strong> over the 2 weeks of prep. We first defined what the investigations’ purposes were, how and what we expected kohai to receive at the end of the workshop, and how to keep engagement high throughout. Then time was spent individually exploring different avenues of how investigations could be experiences within the time slots the investigation was given. After developing mediums for the investigations - which was a presentation in the case of this investigation - we tested them in what we coined as <em>protos</em>. Sempai participate in 30 min test workshops and come out of them with critical feedback on what hooked them on, needed greater clarity and enkindled further curiosity, etc.
        
        p.ml-sect 
          |Critical feedback I received included:  
        ol.ml-sect
          li Putting forth personal opinions to further relatability
          li Reduce teaching to them, and discuss more with them so as to promote their own curiosity.
          li To utilise my own passion & curiosity, and to not let my limited experience with type design constrict what can be tried.
          li Create a more defined structure, possibly by creating a story arc to follow, as well as a more step by step process which builds upon itself.

          |  format that limited the types of engagement kohai could have with the subject matter. I looked at what areas of typography the non-designers of my team resonated with most which was 
          a(href="https://www.nickkolenda.com/font-psychology/", title="title").in-txt perceptual and direct associations
          |. 

        p.ml-sect
          |In addition, of the various exercises I iterated through, those prompting the most enthusiasm were those focusing on sketching 
          a(href="https://ilovetypography.com/typography-terms/typography-terms-g/").in-txt glyphs
          |. <strong> I expanded upon this making it a typeface making exercise, with everyone contributing one glyph each.</strong> This is was intended to introduce collective responsibility along with allowing equal opportunity for expression.

        //- figure.magenta-hover.mr-sect.flex-b

        p.ml-sect 
          |In retrospect, the typeface design could have been framed better. Kohai did develop a greater appreciation for typography and how it affects communication. However, the open-ended nature of the exercise, and a lack of agreed upon direction and constraints lead to the <strong> end result being more lettering than type design </strong>. The designs, while creatively thought out, lacked clarity in their message and direction, at times individually, but more so collectively.

        h2.l-sect#acorns Acorns
        p.ml-sect Acorns were what we called short workshops spanning an hour each. They were run by pairs of sempai, with different topics that had a connecting thread. Along with Kay, a game and event designer, our acorns focused on <em>Tiny Worlds</em>, a concept exploring world-building and big ideas on small scales, and its greater impact.

        //- p.ml-sect 
          |Beyond the initial intention of teaching compositional methods, I used this acorn as an opportunity for kohai to practise well thought-out decisions. I allowed each kohai one polaroid image and encouraged a take on the 
          a(href="http://echo.iat.sfu.ca/library/vanSomeren_94_think_aloud_method.pdf").in-txt Think Aloud Protocol
          |, where they say what decisions they are making and why. This allows them as well as other participant kohai to understand their thought process and justifications for compositional decisions.

I think errors in personal judgement and decision making were those that created the most friction in camp. I would attribute this in my case to a lack of experience in such a role, Though I valued the experience as very important at the time, I underestimated the amount of work needed to make it a successful experience.

          |In terms of designing my investigations and workshops, while I consider them to be run quite successfully, there was room to improve upon their structures in terms of details and being more adaptable to constraints of resources, space and time.
