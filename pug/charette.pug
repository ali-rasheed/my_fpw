        h1 Task
        p Using design cues from Seattle’s architectural landmarks and from building up from a 3 week iteration process, 14 teams were tasked with creating a spatially interesting architectonic form over the span of 2 days, presented with a clear art direction. This included a presentation showing design decisions in front of peers and a team of mentors as well as a high-fidelity scale model of the form.

        h1 Results
        p Placed 2nd place. Praised for cohesive art direction and thought-out architectural program

        h1 Form Investigations
        p The project was a culmination of the skills developed over the term in understanding spatial form, while increasing the expectation bar much higher than before. We began with sketching as well as physical prototyping towards developing a three-dimensional architectonic composition.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.
